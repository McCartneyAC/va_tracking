# va_tracking
school district level statistics to examine tracking and leveled-ness of courses

There are four main folders: one containing various data files, of which `analytic_data.csv` is the most complete file. One contains `R` code for analysis, of which `eda.R` is the most complete file. A third folder has data visualizations in no particular organization. A fourth folder contains past versions of this project as submitted to conferences in preparation of this manuscript for publication.
