# va_tracking
school district level statistics to examine tracking and leveled-ness of courses

~~`analytic_data.csv` contains the final data set with all appropriate variables, including those generated during and after the EDA process. `eda.R` contains regression models and visualizations, some of which are printed as `.png` files in the top level of the project. 

There are four main folders: one containing various data files, of which `analytic_data.csv` is the most complete file. One contains `R` code for analysis, of which `eda.R` is the most complete file. A third folder has data visualizations in no particular organization. A fourth folder contains past versions of this project as submitted to conferences in preparation of this manuscript for publication.
