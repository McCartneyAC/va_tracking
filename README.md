school district level statistics to examine tracking and leveled-ness of courses

There are four main folders: one containing various data files, of which `analytic_data.csv` is the most complete file. One contains `R` code for analysis, of which `eda.R` is the original file. All current work is being done in ` post_feedback_models.R` to incorporate feedback from reviewers in the first round of submission. 

A third folder has data visualizations in no particular organization. A fourth folder contains past versions of this project as submitted to conferences in preparation of this manuscript for publication.

ANDREW TO DO: 
  do an apples-to-apples comparison of d_index for the whole district to d_index for ADV studies (d_ADV?) 
  like `d_adv ~ d_index + census + frpl` within the path analysis.
